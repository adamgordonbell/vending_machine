Problem
Create a vending machine in the language of your choice. 
The vending machine can take any currency you wish, and can sell any products you wish. 
The vending machine can either take the form of an API or a UI (you do not have to implement both). 
The vending machine should respond to basic commands, such as pay and select_products

Your primary objectives:

Represent a basic data model that underlays the functionality.
Prototype (quickly) a simple UI or API endpoints that allows the user to interact with the machine.
Create at least one action in the UI/API that behaves the way the user would expect.
Choose whatever language you wish. 
Some options you might consider: Ruby, GoLang, Python, Scala, Erlang, Haskell, Javascript, Elm, PureScript, and Clojure.
Do not use a full-stack framework such as Rails, Django, or Play. You can use specific components of frameworks, however. (Ex: ActiveRecord)

Things you don't need:

Both an API Backend and working UI. (Feel free to build only one. API endpoints or UI flow.)
Persistence. (You can persist in-memory for now.)
Full implementation of the machine. (One or two actions is enough.)
Unit tests. (Really. We won't judge you.)

Please commit all of your work to a GitHub repository and share it with us once you are complete.
Timeframe
We don't want to take too much of your time working on this challenge - so try to limit yourself working on this over 1 or 2 evenings in the next week.

And don't worry about making everything perfect and robust. Feel free to mock out parts of the code and use open source tools (such as JavaScript boilerplates) to take out the repetitive work. Remember, your goal is to show us your strengths as an engineer, so focus on things that will show off those strengths.
What we are looking for
Thoughtfulness.
Simplicity and speed.
How you communicate and think through design.
Some guidelines to help you get started
As you will notice, this is not a simple algorithms or computer science test. 
We are trying to get an idea for how you think and how you communicate as a teammate.

Some things you might want to consider doing to help us along:

Document your thinking (either in a PR or an Issue)
Why did you choose the frameworks and libraries you did?
What functionality did you choose to focus on? To omit? Why?
What were your design/architecture considerations?
Open issues with any questions you have.
What isn't clear to you?
Which assumptions are you making because of lacking information?
